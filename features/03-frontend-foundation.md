# Feature 03: Frontend Foundation

**Type:** Foundation  
**Dependencies:** 01  
**Objective:** Provide a routed React shell ready for feature pages.

## Mandatory preflight

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md` before starting.** If it does not exist, do not pretend to have read it; report the gap and consult available context files.
2. Read `project-overview.md`, `architecture.md`, `code-standards.md`, `ui-context.md`, `ai-workflow-rules.md` and `progress-tracker.md` where available, focusing on relevant sections.
3. Inspect existing code before editing; preserve approved decisions.
4. Implement **only this feature**. Do not begin dependent or unrelated features.

## Implementation tasks

1. Configure Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
2. Load theme tokens from `ui-context.md` via CSS variables.
3. Create shared app shell, layout slots, error boundary and API client abstraction.
4. Add route placeholders and fallback 404 route.
5. Set up lint and frontend build scripts.

## Scope boundaries

- Do not add authentication; it is excluded from v1. Protect commercially sensitive deployments through approved infrastructure access controls.
- Do not expose GAAP API credentials in frontend code, source control, sample payloads or logs.
- Do not invent GAAP endpoints, currency semantics, product mappings or transaction rules. Record unverified assumptions as blockers.
- Do not combine monetary values from different currencies. Unknown currencies remain `UNKNOWN`.
- Do not overwrite a completed saved report; exports must use saved MongoDB data.
- Use mock fixtures only when clearly labeled; a mocked pass is not live integration evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Navigation renders
- [ ] Dark theme uses tokens
- [ ] Frontend builds
- [ ] Feature follows approved architecture, code standards and UI context.
- [ ] Relevant automated tests pass; affected workspace build succeeds.
- [ ] `progress-tracker.md` updated with files changed, verification evidence, blockers and next feature.

## Verification

1. Run the smallest unit/API/UI tests covering the acceptance criteria.
2. Run `npm run build` for the affected workspace(s); run lint/test scripts if defined.
3. Check failure, empty and invalid-input cases where applicable.
4. Record exact commands, outcomes and any checks not run in `progress-tracker.md`.
5. If live GAAP, MongoDB or Railway access is unavailable, state which claims remain fixture-only.

## Definition of done

The feature accomplishes its stated objective, its acceptance criteria are evidenced, no architecture invariant is broken, and progress documentation is updated. **Stop after this feature** and request approval or the next spec before continuing.
